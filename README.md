<h1/>About 42</h1>
There are no teachers, no tutorials, and no tuition fee. 42 is a school with the most progressive pedagogy. The students at 42 learn with each other and learn from each other. Learning is self-directed and the school is open 24/7. This unique pedagogy fosters a helpful community for students to learn coding and teamwork. The school practices a non-discriminatory application policy â€“ anyone can apply regardless of their social, economic or academic background. One needs only to pass an online test and survive the Piscine - a 26-day non-stop coding experience - before being conferred the title of a <em>Cadet</em> and begin the programme as a student.
